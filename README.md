# Introduction

This is a Total War: Warhammer 3 mod that introduces a new custom spell for Archaeon the Everchosen. This custom spell allows him to control any enemy unit for 1 minute.

This custom spell lays the foundation and showcases how you can create other spells that targets enemy units.

The mod relies heavily on Lua scripting.

See this [blog post](https://dasang.github.io/blog/warhammer_mod/) where I discuss about how this works.
